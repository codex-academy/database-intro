# SQL

Once we have a database we needs way of manipulating the data in it, to insert, query, update and delete the data. This is what SQL is for.

SQL stands for `Structured Query Language`. It's a data manipulation language that allows you to easily find (query) and create data.

SQL has 4 basic operations:

* `insert`;
* `delete`;
* `update`;
* and `select` (find data).

The `select` operation being the one to find existing data in the database.

## Joins

You can use the fields in the tables to link tables together with `join`s.

## CRUD - create, read, update and delete
