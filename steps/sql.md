# SQL

Once one have a database one needs a way of manipulating the data in the database, to insert, query, update and delete the data. This is what SQL is for.

SQL stands for `Structured Query Language`. It's a data manipulation language that allows one to easily find (query) and create data.

SQL has 4 basic operations:

    * insert;
    * delete;
    * update;
    * and select (find data) .

The `select` operation being the one to find existing data in the database the other operations are self explanatory.

## Joins

One uses the fields in the tables to link tables together with joins.

## CRUD - create, read, update and delete

One can use SQL to create some CRUD screens to manipulates data.
