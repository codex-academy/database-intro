A quick introduction to databases.

## Database components

* Fields - individual data values;
* Rows - a collection of fields that belong to one data record;
* Tables - a collection of rows (records) about the same topic. A database can have multiple tables;
* Keys
  * Primary key - a field that makes a row unique;
  * Foreign key - a field that references a key in another table;
* Joins - data from various tables can be combined using Foreign keys.
