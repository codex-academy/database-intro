# Data Modeling and Persistence

Applications need a way of storing and manipulating data. That is what databases are for. Databases make it easy to store, structure, retrieve and manage data.

## Database basics

Databases put data that belong together in tables. Each table has multiple entries called rows. Each row can have multiple fields.

You can link tables using fields by creating a field in one table and referencing that field from another table. These fields are used to create relationships between tables: that's why they're called relational databases.
