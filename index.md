# Data Modeling and Persistence

Applications need a way of storing and manipulating data. That is what databases are for. Databases makes it easy to store, structure, retrieve and manage data.

## Database basics

Databases put data that belongs together in tables; each table has multiple entries called rows and each row can have multiple fields.

One can link tables using fields, by creating a field in one table and referencing that field from another table. These fields are used to create relationships between tables, that's why they're called relational databases.
